# Kanban Board Program

## Description
This program allows you to create a kanban board,
add a custom number of columns (with any name you desire!),
and add tasks to said columns.

Additionally, you can make modifications to the tasks, columns, and boards (also called "projects").
These modifications include adding descriptions for the tasks,
marking tasks as complete or incomplete
(regardless of the column -- which allows you to use these boards as regular kanban boards,
or just a board with columns of tasks), create new projects/boards, and more!

## Running the Program
To run the program, ensure that you have Java installed, as well as JavaFX.
This program uses Java Version 17.

To run the program, simply run the `Main.java` file, which can be found in
the folder `src/main/java/`.

## Program Structure and Information
We have constructed the program according to the Clean Architecture and SOLID principles,
as much as possible. One can see that when in the folder `src/main/java/`, the Java files
are split apart, based on the Clean Architecture layer they belong to.
Further folders have been made within each layer to separate the different
Java files, according to their role within the program.

One can find the database files in
`/src/main/java/d_frameworks_and_drivers/database_management/DatabaseFiles`.
