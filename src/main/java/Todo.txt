1. Database Implementation.
	Specifics:
		• Create 2 interfaces which extends the DBControllers(I think Wendy implemented this already)
		• One of the interface is in the 3rd layer.
			• The interface should have a method that returns all the previously saved Projects in the database (Note:
			returns a list of ProjectModels)
			• This method will get used in ProjectSelectionController's initialize();
		• Other interface is in the 2nd layer.
		    • This is like the DataAccessInterface in the diagram.
		    • This interface should support program functionalities (i.e. updateTaskNameInDatabase,
		    deleteColumnFromDatabase)
		    • This interface will be used by the Use Case classes to update the database. (i.e. there is an instance of
		    this interface in each use case so when Use Case is called, database can be updated from Use Case.)

2. Testing.
    Specifics:
        • Create a suite of test cases.
        • According to Milestone 4 Instructions, it does not need to 100% but "it should be high if you want full marks
        for testing!)

3. Drag-and-drop functionality to swap columns.
    Specifics:
        • Implement the Drag-and-drop functionality of the tasks.
        • Edit the method populateTasksForEachColumn() in ProjectViewingAndModificationPresenter so each Task UI is drag
         and droppable.
        • Handle the case when the user drops it somewhere invalid (i.e. not a column)
        • When the drop is valid, call the method in ProjectViewingAndModificationInteractor.
        • As of now, each Column UI and Task UI has a UUID. So we can assume in the interactor's method, you can have
        the sourceColumnID, targetColumnID, taskID as parameters.

4. Design and fixing GUI bugs.
    Specifics:
        • Improve the current UI of the app (yayyy colours!).
        • In the ProjectSelection, make sure that once a Project is deleted, the rest of the Projects move to fill in
        the space.
        • Improve the UI of the Task to show whether it is completed or not.
        • Display error handling messages.

5. Rename Project (both in ProjectSelection and ProjectViewingAndModification)
    Specifics:
        • In the ProjectSelection view:
            • Create a new Window to ask the user what the new name should be.
            • From the Controller class, class the right interactor method. From the interactor method, call the right
            presenter method.
            • Implement the controller, interactor and presenter methods required for this functionality.
        • In the ProjectViewingAndModification view:
            • Maybe create a new window too to prompt the user what the name should be.
            • Implement the controller, interactor and presenter methods for this function.
            • Note that these methods are different from ProjectSelection since they are different "views".

6. Delete Project (both in ProjectSelction and ProjectViewingAndModification)
    Specifics:
        • In the ProjectSelection view:
            • Create a new Window to ask the user what the new name should be.
            • From the Controller class, class the right interactor method. From the interactor method, call the right
            presenter method.
            • Implement the controller, interactor and presenter methods required for this functionality.
        • In the ProjectViewingAndModification view:
            • Maybe create a new window too to prompt the user what the name should be.
            • Implement the controller, interactor and presenter methods for this function.
            • Note that these methods are different from ProjectSelection since they are different "views".

7. Delete Column
    Specifics:
        • As of now, the classes in the controller and presenter is already implemented.
        • Only method to do is the one in interactor. Need to update database and update the Project entity in
        CurrentProjectRepository.
        • Please call presenter with a ColumnModel as an argument.

8. Rename Column
    Specifics:
        • As of now, the classes in the controller and presenter is already implemented.
        • Only method to do is the one in interactor. Need to update database and update the Project entity in
        CurrentProjectRepository.
        • Please call presenter with a ColumnModel as an argument.
9. Complete a Task.
    Specifics:
        • Create a method in the controller to handle when a task is completed, then call interactor's method.
        • The TaskUI holds the UUID of the task so feel free to assume that the interactor gets a TaskUUID as an
        argument.
        • Update the database and entity.
        • Call the method in the presenter to update the UI. Maybe pass a TaskModel as parameter.
        • Implement the method in Presenter to update the Task in the UI.
        • Since the Task UI holds the UUID, maybe iterate over all UI elements and find whichever match.
        • If they match, then update that Task UI.
10. Automatically update a Task when completed to be in Done (vice versa).
    Specifics:
        • This builds on the Complete Task feature. If the Task is completed, automatically put it in the "Done" column.
        •
