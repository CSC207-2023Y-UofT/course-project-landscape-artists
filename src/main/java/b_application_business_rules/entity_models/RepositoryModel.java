/**
 * This model is going to be a class that contains all the information a Repository entity object would have,
 *
 * it's just that now, the "model" is in the application business rules, as opposed to the enterprise business rules, so,
 * when we pass this up a layer, it's not skipping layers. i think that's really the only reason this model exists 🤷‍♀️
 *
 *
 *
 * in the 04-CleanArchitecture.pdf slides, slide 13, these models would be a part of the input data and output data. i think.
